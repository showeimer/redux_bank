# Redux Bank App

Create an application using React, React Router v4, and Redux to mimic online banking.

## Getting Started

- To get started you will need to use create-react-app to quickly scaffold a project. You should migrate your components into a components folder in the src directory and the styles into a styles folder in the src directory. Link up all pages to make sure they working and test using npm run start in the console, use Ctrl+c to exit.

- You will need use npm install --save redux, npm install --save react-redux, and npm install --save react-router-dom in the terminal to save Redux to your project dependencies and make it available for import.

- In your index.js file in your src directory, you will need to copy and paste the contents of the index.js file from the starter files. This will set up your router and Redux store. Please take note of the way in which this file is set up and how the Router is nested within the Provider from Redux. This is the only way for a router to work correctly with Redux.

- You will need to create a data folder and you should use the users.js from the starter_files and place it inside of the data folder.

- You will need to create containers, actions, and reducers folders as well. You will need to add the corresponding files from the starter files to the folders in your application (for example actions/index.js in the starter files will need to be copied or moved into src/actions/index.js in your project). Be sure to look at these files for hints and placement of certain requirements.

- You should have the following separate components:
  - Components: App.js
  - Components: BaseLayout.js
  - Containers: UserList.js
  - Containers: UserDetail.js
  - Containers: AccountDetail.js
  - Containers: Transaction.js

- You should create a BaseLayout navigation component that wraps the application and provides a navbar for your application. Hint: This should wrap your <Switch> component in your index.js file and allow for {this.props.children} so other components/routes can be rendered within it.

- Your app should mimic the functionality of the example provided at the end of this document.

- In your actions folder, using the index.js file you have been provided, there is one action creator for selecting a user and another for making a withdrawal.
  - You should create another action creator for selecting a specific account of that user and place it where the commented section of code is in that file.

- In your reducer file (reducers/index.js) you will need to make sure that your reducers are working properly. You have been given (from the starter_files) a reducer for selecting a specific user.
  - You will need to create a reducer for your selectAccount action creator.

- In your UserDetail container component, you will need to create a mapDispatchToProps function to gain access to the account from using the action creator. See the comments in that file

- In your UserList component, take the time to review how all of the pieces are working.
  - We create a link out of each user's name and use that to set our URL params that flow through our Router on our index.js src file.

- Your AccountDetail container component will need to be created, and should include the following:
  - import React from react, connect from react-redux, bindActionCreators from redux, a Link from react-router-dom.
  - import { selectAccount } from ../actions/index;
  - AccountDetail should have access to the user that was selected and their account information. You will need to mapStateToProps as you did in the UserDetail container component.
  - the state should reflect the reducers selectedUser and selectedAccount.
  - You will need to connect you mapStateToProps to the AccountDetail component and export it.
  - See the attached video for an idea of how that information should displayed.

- You will need to create a Transaction container component. Inside the Transaction container component you should create a modal that enables you to withdraw money from a selected account (see video for ideas). See Hints Help

- All files should be linked and you should not receive any errors in your console.

- You will need to style your application (don't forget Bootstrap 4 as an easy one!) Change the name, lingo, and look of the project!

## Hints

- The AccountDetail component will need to mapStateToProps - the code to do this will be:

```
function mapStateToProps(state) {
  const userIdx = state.users.findIndex(user => user._id === state.selectedUser);
  const accountIdx = state.users[userIdx].accounts.findIndex(account => account.id === state.selectedAccount);
  return {
    account: state.users[userIdx].accounts[accountIdx],
    user: state.users[userIdx]
  };
}
```

- Don't forget export and to connect your mapStateToProps to your AccountDetail component.

- You will need to create a Transaction component that will provide a modal in which the user can select an amount to withdraw from the current account.

- Double Hint:

  - Reactstrap Getting Started
  - Reactstrap Modals
  - this is a great tool for using Bootstrap components in React, such as a modal.

- The bottom of this component should look something like the following code:

```
function mapStateToProps(state) {
  /*
    You will need to create a similar mapStateToProps as the one used in the AccountDetail component.


  */
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
    return bindActionCreators({
        withdrawFunds: withdrawFunds
    }, dispatch)
}


export default connect(mapStateToProps,  mapDispatchToProps)(Transaction);
```

- The buttons in the modal window can hold a value... this can be helpful for withdrawing the money.

## Hard Mode:  

- Add the ability to add users and delete users and use Redux to do so.

## Super Hard Mode:  

- Add the ability to transfer funds from one account to another, and even one user to another!

## Results

Once complete, you should see the following functionality in your application:
